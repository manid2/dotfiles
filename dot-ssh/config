# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.

#=== doc start ===
# Caution:
# Don't directly install this config file as it contains mainly placeholder
# configs. Instead replace placeholders and modify configs as required before
# installing.

# Examples:
# * SSH Login: `ssh <host_alias>`
# * SCP: `scp <host_alias>:<path> <dst>`

# SSH public key authentication steps:
# * Generate ssh key `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_me -C "tbd"`
# * Copy ssh key to target: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_me user@host`

# Check authentication logs for any error, e.g:
# * `/var/log/auth.log`-> Debian
# * `/var/log/secure` -> CentOS

#== Others i.e. github, gitlab
# NOTE: if key was created with passphrase, then add this key to ssh-agent
# NOTE: change git remote url to use below ssh host in local repo.
# example: git@<md2_gh>:manid2/dotfiles.git

# manid2 on github
Host github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_md2_gh

# manid2 on gitlab
Host gitlab.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_md2_gl

# NOTE: To prevent trying all possible keys by ssh client use only identities
# provided on command line or in ssh_config. Ignore keys provided by ssh-agent.
# This prevents too many authentication failure error.
# To do this set `IdentitiesOnly=yes` as below.
