# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.

# example: `ssh me_dev_2` to login, `scp me_dev_2:<path> <dst>` to copy

#== dev build servers
# NOTE: using placeholders ips and user names
Host me_dev_2 you_dev_2
    HostName 192.168.0.2

Host me_dev_4 you_dev_4
    HostName 192.168.0.4

Host me_dev_2 me_dev_4
    User me
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_me

Host you_dev_2 you_dev_4
    User you
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_you

#== dev test servers
# sample development test server
Host my_dev_ts_xx
    HostName 192.168.0.6
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_dev_ts

#== ST testbed servers
# sample ST test server
Host my_st_ts_xx
    HostName 192.168.0.8
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_st_ts

#== Others i.e. github, gitlab
# NOTE: if key was created with passphrase, then add this key to ssh-agent
# NOTE: change git remote url to use below ssh host in local repo.
# example: git@<md2_gh>:manid2/dotfiles.git

# manid2 on github
Host md2_gh
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa-md2_gh

# manid2 on gitlab
Host md2_gl
    HostName gitlab.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa-md2_gl

# NOTE: To prevent trying all possible keys by ssh client use only identities
# provided on command line or in ssh_config. Ignore keys provided by ssh-agent.
# This prevents too many authentication failure error.
# To do this set `IdentitiesOnly=yes` as below.
