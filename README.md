Swiss army knife of Software Engineer. Handcrafted by my own use cases in
software engineering tasks.

This repository is a collection of system configurations and tools for all my
tasks in coding, admin and general system use.

What problems it solves?
------------------------

* Simplifies complex and repetitive tasks.
* Continuous updates to configurations as the system, software and usage
  pattern changes.
* Synchronizing user configurations and utilities for daily development tasks
  across machines i.e. personal and work PCs.
* Provides a single location to save and restore configurations.

Design
------

Based on Unix philosophies:

* Everything must be a plain text file.
* One tool for one task.
* Make each tool work together to create the Integrated Development
  Environment a.k.a. IDE.
* Minimal changes.
* Portable and scalable.

Install
-------

Use `install` script.

```sh
./install
```

Uninstall
---------

Use `uninstall` script.

```sh
./uninstall
```
